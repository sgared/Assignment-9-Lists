   "source": "'''1.Sudoku is a Japanese puzzle game that became popular in the US in the early 2000â€™s. Despite its simple rules, actually solving a Sudoku puzzle can be quite difficult based upon the amount of starting information. The Sudoku board is made up of a 9 x 9 square grid: each row and each column must contain each value 1-9, without repetition. Additionally, the board can be broken down into 9 non-overlapping smaller 3 x 3 square grids. Each square grid must also contain each value 1-9, without repetition. Write a function that can be used to check if a Sudoku subgrid (3 x 3) is a legal conformation. The function should allow input either as a flat list of 9 elements, or a list of 3 lists, with 3 elements each, and should provide an error for any other input. If the grid is not a legal one, the program should give the user a brief explanation as to why: ie duplicate values in (col/row/grid) or illegal values. (40 points)'''",
